# Hex-Game-for-Android

A game HexGame Interface that defines all methods
Undo feature for a single step
The computer (or user2) makes a new move and draws the board again.
In the Hex Game for PC, the move was not smart. For this application it's "kinda" “smart”. 
I used minimax algorithm to make the moves smart. 
The parameters for the minimax algorithm has parameters like easy, nominal, difficult and the parameters for the game (size, colors, who starts first) are adjustable through the interface. Game has heuristic board evaluation functions, which are be very important for the whole system.
